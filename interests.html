<h2> BEING ACTIVE </h2>

<p>
Staying active while moving around opened the door for me to try out many different activities while I was growing up. Cheer, volleyball, softball, and others proved to be enjoyable for a while, but what I truly became passionate about was gymnastics and dance. 
</p>   
    
<p>
One of my favorite memories of senior year is the finale of our senior dance recital. It was such a special time to reminisce over all of the many years of competitions we participated in, the things I've learned how to do, and the impact my studio had on me. 
</p>
    
<p> 
Aside from organized activities, I also generally enjoy staying active in any way that I can. That typically comes in the form of being outside (walking, boating, hiking, kayaking, etc.) or going to the gym. 
</p>
    
<h2> SPENDING TIMES WITH FRIENDS & FAMILY </h2>   
    
<p>
During my free time, I enjoy spending time with the people I love the most and going out to do fun things. Whether that be going to concerts, the aquarium, catching a movie; you name it and Iâ€™m in. 
</p>
    
<p>
Experiences are such a special way that shapes us into who we become as we grow and mature. 
</p>
    
<h2> TRAVELING + WHERE I WANT TO GO </h2>

    
<p>
Growing up a military child blessed me with an abundant amount of travel opportunities! Every time we have moved, we make it a point to explore our city and find the gems of each location. 
</p>
    
<p>
I have been to almost all of the United States and I can't wait to keep my travels going when it is safe to do so. However, I have always dreamed of traveling the world and have been crafting my travel bucket list since I was a very young age. I love to explore and learn more about the culture of every place I go.
