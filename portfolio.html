<p> Something that I have lived by for quite a while is to “be loud about the things that are important to you and be loyal to your dreams.” I don't believe the importance of being your own cheerleader is talked about enough. Having the support of others is so wonderful, but truly having the confidence and belief in yourself for the things you wish to accomplish is a game changer.  </p>
